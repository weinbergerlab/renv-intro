😕
========================================================

“I tried running the code that you sent me, but I get an error. It says there is no package called ‘something’.”

🙁
========================================================

“Your code used to work fine, but then I updated my packages and now it doesn't work anymore.”

☹️
========================================================

“Sorry to email you this late, but I can't get the code from last week's lecture to work, and the homework is due tomorrow.”

Why?
========================================================

1. Code requires R packages (“dependencies”) to run
2. Sending someone code doesn’t tell them which packages the code requires

renv
========================================================

1. You use `renv` to store information about dependencies with your code
2. Other people use `renv` to install the exact same versions of the dependencies before running your code

Getting started
========================================================

* Make an RStudio project
* Install `renv`
```{r results=FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
```
* Initialize `renv`

```{r}
renv::init()
```

Installing packages
========================================================

* You can use all the usual tools (`install.packages`, `devtools::install_github`, etc)
* Packages are installed *only* for that project

Saving information about dependencies
========================================================

* `renv::snapshot()` saves dependency information

Reinstalling dependencies
========================================================

* `renv::restore()` restores dependencies

Overall workflow
========================================================

You:

1. Create an RStudio project
2. `renv::init()`
3. Work on your code
4. `renv::snapshot()`
5. `renv::clean()`
6. Send code to your collaborators
   * Best option: use git
   * Acceptable option: zip your project folder **except** `renv/library` and `renv/staging`.
   * Don't: just send them your .R files

Collaborator:

1. Open the RStudio project
2. `renv::restore()`
3. The end

renv vs R markdown
========================================================

* `renv` lets your collaborators run your R markdown files
* Converting to HTML/PDF/Word requires additional dependencies
* Consider adding a `dependencies.R` file to your project with the following contents:

```
library(Rcpp)
library(rprojroot)
```
